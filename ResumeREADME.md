Summary:
Hi, my name is Matt. I am a full-stack engineer who writes, scales, and fixes computer programs from start to
finish. Over the last 4 years, I’ve helped businesses increase profits and overall revenue through businessto-business marketing and sales. I’m looking for a chance to kickstart my career in software development in a
challenging, fast-paced environment that prioritizes the individual growth of employees and the collective growth of
the company.
However, my ultimate goal is to be in pastoral ministry someday, and so I've been a student at The Expositors
Seminary in Jupiter, FL since 2019. When trying to grow a new business began to work against my pursuit
of pastoral ministry towards the end of 2020, I decided to scale back my business to be more of a freelance
operation than a full-time one.
So now, I'm currently enrolled in Springboard's Software Engineering Career Track and plan on graduating in May
2021. By then, I'll have a proficiency in full-stack development through JavaScript, HTML, CSS, AJAX, JQuery,
Python, SQL and PostgreSQL, Node, Express, React, and Redux. I hope to use these new skills in a role as a
Full-Stack Engineer for a company in the near future and I am actively looking for job opportunities in the Software
Engineering field today!
